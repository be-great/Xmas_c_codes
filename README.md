# what is C?

C is a procedural high level programming language designed for system and application development. It is a compiled language in the sense that it must pass through the compiler which converts the codes written to a language that the computer understands. It is a general purpose programming Language and it has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers and protocol stacks and even application development (though this is decreasing with the advent of more high level programming languages). It has also be seen used on different computer architectures ranging from supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. It provides low-level access to memory and hardware, making it efficient for tasks like system programming.

# Pros of using C

C is a very old and unique language. it comes with its own special syntax which has even been adopted by modern day languages. The following are some of the reasons why C is preferred even in this modern age:

- **Structure** : C is very structured in that it allows you to break a larger problem into smaller chunks (modularization). It breaks problems into modules and functions that are easier to debug, modify and develop.

- **Portability** : c has the capability to run on different platforms as it is very much machine-dependent thereby making it possible to run on different machines. Even though C is very unique to the UNIX operating system, it still retains it's portability and works on multiple platforms.

- **Rich standard Library** : C comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides a variety of functions for common tasks such as input/output operations, string manipulation, and memory allocation. These libraries make development easier

- **Efficiency & Performance** : C allows for low-level manipulation of data and has minimal runtime overhead, making it highly efficient. Its proximity to machine-level operations allows for fine-tuning and optimization. Also, C is a compiled language making compilation and execution of code speedy since only required features are included.

- **Extensibility** : C codes are extensible in that when a code is written  in C, more features and functionalies can be added with minor alterations

- **Embedded systems development** : C is widely used in embedded system development because of its efficiency and control over hardware resources.

- **Legacy code compatibility** : Many existing software systems and libraries are written in C. Knowledge of C allows developers to maintain and integrate with legacy codebases.

- **Influences on other languages** :
