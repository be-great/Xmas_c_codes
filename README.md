# what is C?

C is a procedural high level programming language designed for system and application development. It is a compiled language in the sense that it must pass through the compiler which converts the codes written to a language that the computer understands. It is a general purpose programming Language and it has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers and protocol stacks and even application development (though this is decreasing with the advent of more high level programming languages). It has also be seen used on different computer architectures ranging from supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems. It provides low-level access to memory and hardware, making it efficient for tasks like system programming.
